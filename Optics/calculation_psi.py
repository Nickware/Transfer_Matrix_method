# The code calculates the ellipsometric angles Psi and Delta for a system with air, SiO2, and Si, varying the thickness of the SiO2 layer.
# It uses the TMM (Transfer Matrix Method) to compute the angles based on the refractive indices of the materials and the wavelength of light.
# The results are plotted, showing how Psi and Delta change with the thickness of the SiO2 layer.
# The plot shows that as the thickness of the SiO2 layer increases, both Psi and Delta angles change, indicating the influence of the layer on the ellipsometric measurements.
# The code uses the TMM (Transfer Matrix Method) to compute the ellipsometric angles Psi and Delta for a system with air, SiO2, and Si, varying the thickness of the SiO2 layer.    
# This example is based on the example from the book "Optical waves in layered media" by Pochi and Pochi Yeh, 1983, Wiley.
# This example is a copy of the examples of the repository https://github.com/sbyrnes321/tmm
# Should agree with Handbook of Ellipsometry by Tompkins, 2005.
